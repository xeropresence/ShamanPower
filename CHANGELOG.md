# ShamanPower Changelog

## v1.6.0 (2026-02-05)

### Bug Fixes
- **Cooldown bar combat lockdown protection**: Fixed taint errors where `SetSize()` and `Show()`/`Hide()` on the cooldown bar could be blocked during combat if another addon (e.g. Atlas) spread taint; layout and visibility updates are now deferred until combat ends

## v1.5.9 (2026-02-05)

### New Features
- **Weapon Imbue Left/Right-Click**: Left-click applies imbue to main hand, right-click applies to off hand (both on parent button and flyout)
  - Uses the `/cast [@none]` + `/use slot` macro pattern for reliable weapon targeting
  - Auto-confirms the replacement dialog via `/click StaticPopup1Button1`
  - Tooltips now show click hints (off hand hint only visible if dual wielding)
- **Sound Volume Sliders**: Added volume sliders next to each "Play Sound" toggle across Raid Cooldowns, Reactive Totems, Expiring Alerts, and Tremor Reminder
  - Control alert volume from 0% to 100% per module
  - Routes through the Dialog sound channel — requires Dialog volume set to 100% in WoW audio settings
- **Cooldown Text Color Picker**: Added a color picker for totem cooldown text (under the "Show Totem Cooldowns" toggle)
  - Defaults to white; disabled when cooldowns are toggled off
- **Elemental Mastery on Cooldown Bar**: Added Elemental Mastery as a trackable cooldown bar item (Elemental talent)
- **Split Imbue Icon**: Weapon imbue icon vertically splits to show both imbue icons when main hand and off hand have different imbues
- **Imbue Sweep Overlay**: Weapon imbue icon now shows a color-to-grey vertical sweep as the imbue expires, matching the other cooldown bar icons
- **Duration Text Size Slider**: Added an independent font size slider (6-20) for cooldown bar duration text, separate from progress bar size

### Improvements
- **Totemic Call icon desaturated when no totems active**: The Totemic Call icon on the cooldown bar is now greyed out when no totems are placed, and colorizes when any totem is active
- **Weapon imbue bars unified and dual-tracking**: Weapon imbues now use the same progress-bar system as other cooldowns and show separate bars for main-hand and off-hand when both are active; single imbues expand to full-width.
- **Flyout Requires Right-Click applies to Cooldown Bar**: The "Flyout Requires Right-Click" option now also applies to shield and weapon imbue flyouts on the cooldown bar
- **Spell-colored progress bars preserve urgency colors**: Spell-colored bars now only replace the green (healthy) color; yellow and red time-based colors still show when time is running low

### Changes
- **Play Sound defaults to OFF**: The "Play Sound" toggle for Reactive Totems, Expiring Alerts (shields, totems, weapon imbues), and Tremor Reminder now defaults to off for new users
- **Totem/Cooldown Bar opacity minimum lowered to 0%**: Both bars can now be fully transparent

### Bug Fixes
- **Cooldown text visibility**: Fixed cooldown text rendering behind the cooldown swipe overlay, making it hard to read
- **Cooldown bar progress bar position**: Fixed "Bottom (Horizontal)" progress bars appearing at the top of the frame instead of the bottom
- **Cooldown bar dynamic frame sizing**: The cooldown bar frame now only expands to make room for progress bars when a cooldown is actually active, instead of always reserving the space
- **Missing pulse bars**: Added pulse tracking for Magma Totem (Fire) and Mana Spring Totem (Water) which were missing from the pulse overlay system
- **"On Icon" progress bar position**: Fixed "On Icon (Left & Right)" progress bars adding extra padding/spacing instead of rendering on the icon itself
- **Rockbiter imbue icon**: Fixed Rockbiter weapon imbue showing as Windfury icon due to missing enchant ID fallback

## [v1.5.7](https://github.com/taubut/ShamanPower/releases/tag/v1.5.7) (2026-02-02)

### New Features
- **Right-Click Drops Corner Totem**: New option in Settings > Totem Bar Mode (appears when TotemTimers Style Display is enabled)
  - When enabled, right-clicking a totem button drops the assigned totem (shown in the corner indicator) instead of casting Totemic Call
  - Useful for quickly switching between your active and assigned totems

### Bug Fixes
- **TotemTimers range display fix**: Fixed totem icons flickering between grey and normal when moving in/out of range while using TotemTimers Style Display
  - The range check (greying out icons when out of totem range) now works correctly with TotemTimers mode

## [v1.5.6](https://github.com/taubut/ShamanPower/releases/tag/v1.5.6) (2026-02-02)

### New Features
- **Totem Twisting option in Settings**: Added "Enable Totem Twisting" toggle to Settings > Totem Bar Mode (same as the checkbox in /sp totems, now also accessible in the options panel)
- **Twist Timer: Hide Decimals**: New sub-option (shown when twisting is enabled) to show whole seconds only on the twist countdown (e.g., "8" instead of "8.3")
- **Totem Cooldown Display**: Show cooldown swipe and remaining time on totems that have cooldowns
  - Displays on both the main totem button and in the flyout menu
  - Affects totems with cooldowns: Grounding Totem, Mana Tide Totem, Stoneclaw Totem, Fire Nova Totem, Earth Elemental, Fire Elemental
  - Shows cooldown swipe animation plus countdown text (minutes or seconds)
  - Enabled by default - can be toggled in Look & Feel > Totem Bar > "Show Totem Cooldowns"
- **Totem Flyout Customization**: New "Totem Flyouts" section in Look & Feel
  - Enable/disable individual totems from appearing in flyout menus
  - Organized by element (Earth, Fire, Water, Air) with colored headers
  - Hide totems you never use to keep your flyouts cleaner
  - All totems enabled by default

### Improvements
- **Improved macro reset timers**: Drop All and Twist macros now use `reset=combat/15` instead of just combat reset
  - Macros will reset 15 seconds after last use OR when leaving combat, whichever comes first
  - Prevents macros from getting stuck mid-sequence if combat ends unexpectedly
  - One-time automatic migration for existing users updating from v1.5.5 or earlier

### Bug Fixes
- **TotemTimers style + Twisting fix**: Fixed Air totem icon rapidly flickering when both "TotemTimers Style Display" and "Twist" options are enabled
  - Now correctly shows the currently active totem icon (Windfury or Grace of Air) instead of always showing the assigned totem
- **TotemTimers style flyout fix**: Fixed flyout menu showing wrong totem when using "TotemTimers Style Display"
  - Previously, the flyout would hide the assigned totem while the main button icon showed the active totem (causing visual confusion like Mana Tide appearing on both the main button and in the flyout)
  - Now correctly hides the active totem from the flyout, so the totem shown on the main button icon doesn't also appear in the flyout

## [v1.5.5](https://github.com/taubut/ShamanPower/releases/tag/v1.5.5) (2026-02-02)

### New Features

  - Icon greys out when you have no Ankhs in your inventory
  - Optional Ankh count display in bottom right corner (enable in Look & Feel > Cooldown Display)
  - Count is color coded: Red (0), Yellow (1-3), White (4+)

### Improvements
- **Macro icons now use dynamic spell icons**: All ShamanPower-created macros now use the `?` icon, allowing `#showtooltip` to dynamically display the correct spell icon
  - Affects totem macros (SP_Earth, SP_Fire, SP_Water, SP_Air), Drop All (SP_DropAll), Totemic Call (SP_Recall), and Earth Shield macro
  - One-time automatic migration for existing users updating from v1.5.4 or earlier

  - Works correctly when "Party Buff Tracker" is disabled - shaman can still see their own totem range
- **TOC Interface version**: Updated all module TOC files to correct Interface version (20505) so they no longer show as "Out of date" in the addon list
- **ES Tracker caster name**: Fixed Earth Shield Tracker showing "Unknown" for caster name due to broken API return value handling in Classic TBC
