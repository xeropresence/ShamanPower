# ShamanPower

A totem coordination addon for Shamans in World of Warcraft TBC Anniversary. Think of it as **PallyPower for Shamans** - coordinate totem assignments across your raid so every party gets the buffs they need.

### Auto-Drop Button

- Cycles through your assigned totems (Earth → Fire → Water → Air)
- Configurable via keybinds for fast totem management

### Earth Shield Tracking
- Assign Earth Shield targets for Restoration shamans
- Visual button to quickly cast Earth Shield on your assigned target
- See Earth Shield assignments across all resto shamans in raid

### Raid Sync

### Weapon Enchant Tracking

## TotemTimers Integration

ShamanPower integrates with [TotemTimers](https://github.com/taubut/TotemTimers) (taubut's fork) to provide seamless totem management:

- **Sync Assignments:** Your ShamanPower totem assignments automatically sync to your TotemTimers totem bar
- **One Addon, Two UIs:** Use ShamanPower's grid for raid coordination, TotemTimers for personal totem tracking and timers
- **No Double Configuration:** Set your totems in ShamanPower and they appear on your TotemTimers bar

To enable sync, make sure "Sync to TotemTimers" is enabled in ShamanPower options (enabled by default).
